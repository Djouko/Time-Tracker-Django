## Development Notes

Sure! Hereâ€™s a concise version in English:

- **Time spent**: 2 weeks
  - I dedicated two weeks to designing, developing, and testing the time tracking application, allowing me to focus on each feature while ensuring code quality.

- **Liked aspects**: 
  - I enjoyed working with Django for its clear structure and powerful tools for rapid web application development. Implementing the timer and time log management was a rewarding challenge.

- **Areas for improvement**: 
  - While the application is functional, the user interface could be enhanced with a more modern and responsive design. Additionally, adding unit and integration tests would strengthen the application's robustness.

- **Future enhancements**: 
  - With more time, I would like to integrate features such as visualizations of time spent on tasks, notifications to remind users to start or stop tracking, and a more advanced authentication system for user management.
